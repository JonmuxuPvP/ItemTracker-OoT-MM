# ItemTracker-OoT-MM-Combo-Randomizer
Item Tracker for Ocarina of Time + Majora's Mask Combo Randomizer

---
## Items
Tracks all of the items from both games, including:
* Inventory
* Masks
* Equipment
* Quest Status
---

## Map Tracker
The map tracker is a feature that is yet to be implemented. 

Each item check will reveal different spots on Hyrule Field or Termina Field based on certain logic, whether it's glitched or glitchless logic.

This OoT+MM combo randomizer adds a few new checks compared to other randomizer software due to the items that are also randomized, such as:
* Ocarina of Time in Majora's Mask (Skull Kid Check)
* Kokiri/Master Sword since they are progressive upgrades.

## Support
Any issues and pull requests are much appreciated in order to improve this item/map tracker.

This repository also welcomes other developers to collaborate in this project, as it is open source. If you want to collaborate, hit me up on Discord: Jonmuxu#1727
